    <h1>DOGS</h1>

    <p>Dogs are domesticated carnivores of the family Canidae</p>
    <p>Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</p>
    <p>Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hunting</li>
      <li>Herding</li>
      <li>Pulling loads</li>
      <li>Protection</li>
      <li>Assisting police and military</li>
      <li>Companionship </li>
    </ul>
